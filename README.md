# Tab-dash.live ðŸŽ‰

**Welcome to Tab Dash!** The tab that does *literally* nothing until you stare at it long enough. Even then, it still does quite literally and virtually `nothing`. Mostly. Built for devs, sysadmins, and anyone who needs their browser tabs to serve serious looks and pointless information.

## Features

- **ðŸ’» "Whatâ€™s My IP?"** â€“ Sometimes, we just need our public IP real quick nah wut i mean?
- **âœ¨ Random Quotes** â€“ Enlightening (?) dev quotes pop up for those who think they needed inspiration but maybe didnâ€™t.
- **ðŸŽ¬ Backgrounds** â€“ Choose from glitchy videos that make you look way more legit than you are.
- **ðŸŽ¶ Sounds** - Mouse, keyboard and epic sounds to make it sound like you're actually working.
